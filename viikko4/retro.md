The idea of retrospective is to ask the group members for feedback of the last iteration.
There are many ways to hold a retro meeting but the main idea is to get some feedback on what to start and stop doing in the upcoming sprints in order to boost productivity and group work. 

Two method that was described in the exercise are the basic ones: Just drawing a circle on a poster and divide it into sections of start, stop, continue, more of and less of, and then let the group members fill them up. This way we get some general idea about everything.
The second method is called glad, sad, mad, is basically each member writing either good or a bad observation and then placing in into a whiteboard and then dividing them again into 3 sections. Then the whole group discuss these observation together, whether they should continue doing it or not.
